# ArtifactsMMO. My automation
### https://artifactsmmo.com/

### Description
This is just a silly little side project. Playing a coding MMO.


### TODO
- [ ] Overall action cooldown has to be frequently called by some other module and parsed to all others to not repeat it everywhere
- [ ] More console logging
- [x] Make an auto-fight command
- [ ] Change deposit command so that it would move to the bank tile and then deposit every possible item in the game to the bank (as the default setting), also deposit gold
- [ ] Add actions for recycling, withdrawing from bank, (and gold), Grand Exchange actions, accepting and turning in quests, getting char logs, get what's inside bank
- [ ] Make a forever automatic gatherer that self-deposits, make it configurable by required crafting items (would get bank items to reach the required amount)
- [ ] Add a consumable crafter that also checks inventory/bank for pots for efficient fighting
- [ ] Make it all readable!
